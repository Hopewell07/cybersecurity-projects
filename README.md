Welcome to my Cybersecurity Projects repository! This repo showcases my learning journey and hands-on experience with practical cybersecurity skills,
covering areas such as log analysis, permission audits, SQL filtering, and more.

📚 About the Projects
These projects demonstrate real-world cybersecurity tasks including:

Log file parsing and analysis

User permission auditing

SQL-based log filtering

Each project folder contains its own README with details, scripts, and any required data or outputs.

🚧 Projects : Project	Descriptions

project1-log-analysis	A Python script that analyzes login attempt logs to identify suspicious activity.

project2-permission-audit	Audits user file permissions to detect overly permissive access and potential misconfigurations.

project3-sql-log-filtering	Uses SQLite to filter and analyze structured log data based on multiple conditions.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Python 3
SQLite3
Bash / Linux CLI tools
Log files (realistic & simulated)

Upcoming plans include:
