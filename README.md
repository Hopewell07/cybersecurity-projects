# üîê Project 1: Failed Login Attempt Analyzer

This script scans a sample auth log file for suspicious IP addresses with multiple failed login attempts.# üîê Project 1: Failed Login Attempt Analyzer

This script scans a sample auth log file for suspicious IP addresses with multiple failed login attempts.

## üíª How I Simulated the Log File

I used a sample file `auth.log` and simulated failed login attempts by appending entries. Then used this command to run the script:

Below is the failed login attempts executed on my own machine, hence that's why all theses failed attempts use the same 
local address (127.0.0.1 ).They show different times and and dates of the login attempots.

```bash
python3 log_analysis.py
